This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# What is this project?

This project is a simple Next.js app that builds a front end for the cointree price API.
I chose Next.js over pure React, as React.Dev suggests using it for creating a react app, and it's build in SSR is very useful for performance.

## Getting Started

I prefer using PNPM for installing dependencies, as it is faster, and lighter.

First, follow the instructions [here](https://pnpm.io/installation) to install PNPM

### Installing Dependencies

```
pnpm install
```

### Building

```
pnpm build
```

### Testing

```
pnpm test
```

### Development

First, run the development server:

```
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
